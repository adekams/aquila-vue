# aquila-vue

Implement - as much as you can - the design shown in the image attached below. (Using Vue)
Somethings to note:
1/ The value for the main name displayed on the page will be gotten from a call to an API endpoint.
2/ The contact / social media links on the right are also to be populated dynamically using values gotten from a call to an API endpoint.

The API endpoint to get the data from is: [GET] (https://hirng-x2021.glitch.me/api)

The sample response is:
{
  "name": "AQUILA AVEION",
  "social_media": {
    "twitter": "aquilaveion",
    "instagram": "aquilaveionofficial",
    "snapchat": "aquilaveionsnaps",
    "email": "aquilaveion@aquil.com"
  }
}


The 2 items listed above are the basic requirements. Feel free to extend or add any extra thing that comes to mind.
